# CrickInfoBackend
This backend project is built using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL. It serves as a RESTful API for fetching and managing cricket match data, including live match scores, points table data, and all match listings. The application scrapes data from Cricbuzz using the Jsoup library and stores it in a MySQL database.
